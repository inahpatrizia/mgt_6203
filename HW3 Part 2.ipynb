    "**For Homework 3 Part 2, please use this R notebook in Vocareum to submit your solutions. Vocareum is an educational cloud platform for programming in several languages; it is based on the Jupyter notebook environment. This platform allows us to move homework assignments to the cloud. The advantages are that all of you will be working in the same coding environment AND peer reviewers will be able to run your R code easily. This way we eliminate some issues we might encounter when working on an individual/local basis, such as library installations and Rstudio OS requirements; R notebooks work on mobile platforms and tablets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**With R notebooks, you will be learning a new way of presenting data analysis reports, that is neat and flexible, where formatted (English) text and (R) code can easily coexist on the same page. Notebooks can be also collaborative when needed. For now, we are asking each of you to do your own work for homework. Think of R notebooks as interactive program-based Google docs or MS-Office 360 docs; these are gradually replacing local files on our computers. **\n",

    "<li>Vocareum has its own cloud based file system, the data files you will be using for the assignments will be stored in the cloud with path **\"../resource/asnlib/publicdata/FILENAME.csv\"**. You will be able to import them with the same method as you do in RStudio, simply substitute the path name to the one specified in the instructions.

To change a code cell to a markdown cell, click on the cell, and in the dropdown menu above, switch the type of the cell block from \"code\" to \"markdown\". **Adding print statements to code cells for short response/interpretation questions is also fine, as long as we can clearly see the output of your response**.</li>\n",

Jupyter notebook also support LaTeX.</li>\n",
